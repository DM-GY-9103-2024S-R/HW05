    "One technique for doing this with images uses something called *bitmasking* and *bit shifting* on individual pixel values. What this means is that we can use each pixel value of the image to hold information about $2$ images, but in a way that isn't as obvious as some of the previous methods we looked at so far.\n",

    "\n",
    "One way we can do that is by first rounding the numbers to the nearest $100$, creating numbers that only use two digits ($1200$ and $2700$), and then combining these into a single 4-digit number, $1227$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can undo this transformation to get back the numbers $1200$ and $2700$, which aren't exactly $1242$ and $2664$, but are close enough.\n",
